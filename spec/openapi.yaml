    CERN Analysis Preservation offers a REST API to access the service
    independently from the web interface. This allows users to automate specific
    tasks or create their own data interface, using simple HTTP calls.


    # Introduction

    CERN Analysis Preservation provides a RESTful API, built on HTTP. It tries
    to provide a predictable interface, that includes:

    * resource URLs,

    * HTTP response codes to indicate success/errors, and

    * accepts and returns JSON in the HTTP body.


    You can use your favorite HTTP/REST library for your programming language to
    use CAP's API, or you can use one of our SDKs (CLI clients), currently
    available in Python. Every action from our app is implemented using REST
    endpoints, all of which are documented and available, in order to bea easily
    accessible for automations and integrations into specific workflowsor
    data-related apps.


    # Authentication

    If you want to gain access to CERN Analysis Preservation from your console
    or any external means other

    than the web portal you will need an access token to authenticate with the
    portal. You can create

    multiple tokens for different services.


    CAP offers the following forms of authentication:
      - API Key - `access_token`
