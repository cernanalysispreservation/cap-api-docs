  Your access token will allow you to use the service in the same way you would
  use it through the web portal. It gives full access to your account and anyone who has this token can log in as yourself to the service.


  Do not share your personal access token with anyone else, and only use it with HTTPS.


  To get an access token, you will need to log in on the web portal and [create
  one](https://analysispreservation.cern.ch/settings) by clicking on `Add Token` as shown below.

  Once you have created your token, you can see the generated key in the settings page
  where your list of tokens is stored. It is also possible to revoke a token.
