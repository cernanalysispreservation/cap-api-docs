  summary: Upload files/data
  description: |
    Upload files/data to your analysis, in a specified deposit record.
    The following type of uploads are possible:
      * Local files
      * Git repos
      * URL linked files

    The API differentiates between whole repos (saved as .tar) and single files
    from repos, so the parameter "type" is necessary.
